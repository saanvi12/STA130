    "Analysis 1: The Link Between Social Interaction Frequency and Well-being\n",
    "\n",
    "\t•\tVariables:\n",
    "\t•\tMain Variables: “Social Interaction Frequency” (e.g., number of interactions per week) and “Well-being Score” (a self-reported measure of overall life satisfaction or happiness).\n",
    "\t•\tOptional: Demographic factors like age and employment status for additional depth in certain subgroups.\n",
    "\t•\tMethodology:\n",
    "	I will take basic summary statistics and create a scatter plot to visualize the relationship between interaction frequency and well-being. Then, I’ll use correlation analysis to measure the strength of this relationship. If it seems useful to go deeper, I could also apply simple linear regression to predict well-being based on interaction frequency.\n",
    "\t•\tHypotheses and Expected Results:\n",
    "My expectation is that individuals with high network centrality scores (more varied interactions) will show better resilience, suggesting that having a mix of both in-person and virtual interactions supports adaptability and stress management. Those with limited networks, where one type of interaction dominates, might have lower resilience scores.\n",
    "\t•\tRelevance:\n",
    "This analysis could highlight the importance of a balanced interaction network in building resilience. For GenWell and CASCH, such findings could directly inform messaging that encourages people to diversify their social interactions, a potentially effective strategy for community health.\n",

    "Analysis 2: Sentiment Analysis of Motivations for Community Engagement\n",
    "\n",
    "\t•\tVariables:\n",
    "\t•\tMain: Open-ended responses on motivations for community engagement.\n",
    "\t•\tAdditional: “Community Satisfaction Score” to see if motivation type impacts satisfaction.\n",
    "\t•\tMethodology:\n",
    "Here, I’ll use sentiment analysis and topic modeling to break down the open-text responses. Sentiment scoring (positive, neutral, negative) will give an overall emotional tone to each response, while topic modeling will identify specific themes in responses (like “growth,” “obligation,” “social connection”). By linking these themes and tones to community satisfaction scores, I can see if different motivations correlate with different levels of satisfaction.\n",
    "\t•\tExpected Results:\n",
    "I expect to see a positive correlation: people who report frequent social interactions may also report higher well-being. This analysis would provide evidence for the idea that social engagement can boost mental health..\n",
    "\t•\tRelevance:\n",
    "These findings would be valuable for GenWell or CASCH, as they could use this data to encourage regular social interactions to improve well-being. If the analysis supports this idea, it could help back messaging that promotes staying connected as a way to stay healthy.\n",

    "Analysis 3: Survival Analysis on Loneliness and Mental Health Decline\n",
    "\n",
    "\t•\tVariables:\n",
    "\t•\tPredictor: “Loneliness Score” at baseline.\n",
    "\t•\tOutcome: Any significant mental health decline (tracked over survey waves).\n",
    "\t•\tCovariates: Demographics like age and employment status, plus “Frequency of Social Interactions.”\n",
    "\t•\tMethodology:\n",
    "I’ll use survival analysis, specifically Cox proportional hazards regression, to see if loneliness at baseline can predict a decline in mental health over time. This approach lets us estimate both the timing and size of the effect, giving a “hazard ratio” for loneliness and allowing for targeted timing in interventions.\n",
    "\t•\tHypotheses and Expected Results:\n",
    "I expect higher loneliness scores to correspond with a higher likelihood of mental health decline, especially among those with low social interaction frequency. This would highlight loneliness as a risk factor with a clear timeline, suggesting a specific period where interventions could be most effective.\n",
    "\t•\tRelevance:\n",
    "This analysis could help identify individuals at high risk for mental health issues due to loneliness, and suggest the ideal timeframe for interventions. For GenWell and CASCH, it provides a basis for creating urgency-focused messaging around the importance of early intervention in loneliness.\n",
