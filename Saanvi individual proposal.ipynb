    "Analysis 1: Link Between Social Interaction Frequency and Well-being\n",
    "\n",
    "\t•\tVariables:\n",
    "\t•\tMain Variables: “Social Interaction Frequency” (e.g., number of interactions per week) and “Well-being Score” (a self-reported measure of overall life satisfaction or happiness).\n",
    "\t•\tMethodology:\n",
    "\t•\tI will take basic summary statistics and create a scatter plot to visualize the relationship between interaction frequency and well-being. Then, I’ll use correlation analysis to measure the strength of this relationship. If it seems useful to go deeper, I could also apply simple linear regression to predict well-being based on interaction frequency.\n",
    "\n",
    "\t•\tI expect to see a positive correlation: people who report frequent social interactions may also report higher well-being. This analysis would provide evidence for the idea that social engagement can boost mental health.\n",
    "\t•\tRelevance: These findings would be valuable for GenWell or CASCH, as they could use this data to encourage regular social interactions to improve well-being. If the analysis supports this idea, it could help back messaging that promotes staying connected as a way to stay healthy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Analysis 2: Loneliness Levels Among Different Age Groups\n",
    "\n",
    "\t•\tVariables:\n",
    "\t•\tMain Variables: “Loneliness Score” (self-reported level of loneliness) and “Age Group” (categorical variable: e.g., young adults, middle-aged, seniors).\n",
    "\t•\tMethodology:\n",
    "\t•\tI’ll use group comparison techniques, such as calculating average loneliness scores for each age group. A bar chart will be useful to visualize these averages and easily spot any differences. To get a more precise understanding, I could apply a one-way ANOVA to test if there’s a statistically significant difference in loneliness across age groups.\n",
    "\t\n",
    "\t•\tI might find that certain age groups, like young adults or seniors, report higher loneliness levels than others. This could reveal that loneliness affects some groups more than others.\n",
    "\t•\tRelevance: If specific age groups are more affected by loneliness, GenWell and CASCH could use this information to target those groups in campaigns to combat loneliness. This analysis supports the project’s goal of understanding the role of social connection and could help direct outreach efforts where they’re most needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Analysis 3: How Community Engagement Relates to Mental Health\n",
    "\n",
    "\t•\tVariables:\n",
    "\t•\tMain Variables: “Community Engagement Level” (a measure based on how often respondents participate in community activities) and “Mental Health Score” (self-reported mental health rating).\n",
    "\t•\tMethodology:\n",
    "\t•\tI’ll start with a cross-tabulation to look at how many people in each mental health category (e.g., low, medium, high) also have different levels of community engagement (e.g., low, medium, high). A stacked bar chart will then help visualize these results. If it’s helpful to examine the strength of the relationship, I could calculate the correlation between community engagement and mental health scores.\n",
    "\n",
    "\t•\tI expect to find a positive association, where people with higher community engagement report better mental health. This would support the idea that being part of a community positively impacts mental health.\n",
    "\t•\tRelevance: These findings could provide practical insights for CASCH and GenWell, suggesting that promoting community activities might be beneficial for mental health. This analysis directly aligns with the project’s goals by showing a potential benefit of community involvement for personal well-being.\n"
